User Profile Sample App- Developed with DOCKER  (Using MongoDB and MongoExpress)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This App shows user profile app using

1. index.html with js and css style
2. nodejs backend with express module.
3. mongodb for data storage.
----------------------------------------
All components are docker -based.

Docker:-
Starting the Application

Step 1: Create docker network
docker network create mongo-network 

Step 2: start mongodb (Refer to Environment Variables section of mongo db docker distribution of the link: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password --name mongodb --net mongo-network mongo    

Step 3: start mongo-express (Refer to Configuration section of mongo express docker distribution of the link: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express)
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password --net mongo-network --name mongo-express -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb mongo-express   

Note:- both the mongodb and mongo-express are running in the network named 'mongo-network' above.

Optional:- we can check the logs to see the details of how the mongo-express is communicating with the mongodb. (Ex:- docker logs e853bb8321)

Step 4:- Now check the logs of the mongo-express as 'docker logs f96e37' and you can see mongo-express is running at http://localhost:8081 as shown below.
Mongo Express server listening at http://0.0.0.0:8081
Server is open to allow connections from anyone (0.0.0.0)
basicAuth credentials are "admin:pass", it is recommended you change this in your config.js!

step 5:- Navigate to the url http://localhost:8081 and enter username as admin and password as pass. You can see the mongo express dashboard.

Step 6:- Create my-db database and users collection in mongo-express

Step 7:- Start your nodejs application locally ..navigate to the app directory of the project and run below
				npm install
				node server.js

Step 8:- Access your nodejs application UI from the browser.
			  http://localhost:3000
